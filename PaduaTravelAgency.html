	 <!-- These are Personal reviews from real people who have traveled to Madiera-->
	 
	 
	 <h1> Here are some personal reviews to help with your decision on where to travel too!</h1>
	 
	 <h1> Go East full tour day</h1>
		 <p> We had an excellent tour of the east of the island. We drove up to the highest point on the island, with fabulous views. We stopped for lunch in Santana, which was excellent value at 13.5 euros for 3 courses with wine and coffee. Whilst there we saw the replicas of the thatched roof traditional houses. There were a few other stops before finally going to a man-made sandy beach at Machico. For 20 euros it was an excellent day out".</p>
	 
	 
	 <h1> Brilliant Car Hire Service</h1>
		 <p> "We wanted to hire a car for a couple of days to explore Madeira. The process was extremely simple and the staff were so helpful. Nothing was too much trouble - the car was delivered to our hotel at exactly the time they said it would be and collected from us just as easily. We were a little concerned as the deal they were offering was much cheaper than anything else we had been offered. I would strongly recommend using Madeira Happy Tours for car hire".</p>
	 
		 
		 
		 <h1> Half Day nun Valley tour</h1>
		 <p> "Booked 3 tours with David who was very polite and helpful. Driver Teixeira was prompt and very friendly. Very skilfull driving, pointing out landmarks and things of interest along the way. The valley of the nuns is just incredible! The views truly are breathtaking! Altogether there were 4 stops with 20 to 30 minutes each time. Thank you Teixeira for the restaurant tip (Bella Ilha) it was one of the best meals I've ever experienced!"</p>
		 
		 <p> We hope this was a very helpful way to help you decide what to do on this beautiful island!!</p>
